"""
Implements: Dirichlet's Box Principle / Pigeonhole Principle (PHP), Maximum Independent
Set bounds, and Local Degree Saturation for feasibility pre-check.

Discrete Mathematics Core:
- Generalized Pigeonhole Principle: If n items are placed into k boxes, then at least
  one box must contain at least ceil(n/k) items.
- Maximum Independent Set alpha(G): In the room adjacency graph G, any set of seats
  allocated to the same class must form an independent set (no two adjacent). Therefore,
  for any class C_i, if |C_i| > alpha(G), a collision is mathematically inevitable.
- Local Degree Saturation: For any seat v with degree d(v), the closed neighborhood
  N[v] has size d(v) + 1. If the remaining available classes or subjects are fewer
  than required by the local density, an adjacency collision is forced.
