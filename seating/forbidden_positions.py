r"""
Implements: Rook polynomial / forbidden positions technique for special-needs seat restriction.

Discrete Mathematics Core:
- Combinatorics of Forbidden Positions: Given a set of objects X = {x_1, ..., x_m} to be
  placed into positions Y = {y_1, ..., y_n}, a subset of positions F_i subset Y is forbidden
  for object x_i. The forbidden board is B = union ({x_i} x F_i).
- Rook Polynomial R(x, B): Encodes the number of ways r_k(B) to place k non-attacking rooks
  on the forbidden cells: R(x, B) = sum_{k=0} r_k(B) x^k.
- Permutation on Complementary Board: Valid assignments correspond to placing m non-attacking
  rooks strictly on the complement board B' = (X x Y) \ B, ensuring zero rooks fall on
  forbidden cells: r_m(B') with hard adjacency restrictions.
