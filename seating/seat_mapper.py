"""
Implements: Graph Homomorphism and Soft-Constraint Optimization (minimizing subject conflicts
via bipartite/k-partition seat mapping).

Discrete Mathematics Core:
- Bipartite Grid Partitions & Independent Sets: An orthogonal seat grid is a bipartite graph
  G_seats = (V_0 union V_1, E) where no two vertices in V_0 are adjacent, and no two
  vertices in V_1 are adjacent.
- Homomorphic Embedding: Placing students such that student classes map to independent
  partitions ensures the hard constraint (no adjacent same-class students) is satisfied.
- Soft-Constraint Minimization: Within each partition, students are assigned to seats using
  a min-conflict greedy heuristic that penalizes same-subject adjacency:
    cost(seat, student) = sum_{(seat, v) in E} 1_{subject(student) == subject(seated_at(v))}
  When min cost > 0, the constraint is relaxed and explicitly logged.
